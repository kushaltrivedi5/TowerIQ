- Custom gradient backgrounds
- Glass-effect components
- Consistent color scheme
- Smooth transitions
- Responsive design

## üì± Responsive Design

- Mobile-first approach
- Breakpoints:
  - sm: 640px

  - lg: 1024px
  - xl: 1280px
  - 2xl: 1536px

## üîê Authentication

The application uses NextAuth.js for authentication with the following features:

- Email/Password authentication
- JWT-based session management
- Protected routes with middleware

### Mock Credentials

For development and testing, the following mock users are available:

| Email                | Password    |
| -------------------- | ----------- |
| alice@enterprise.com | password123 |
| bob@enterprise.com   | password123 |

### Route Protection

The application uses middleware to protect routes:

- Public routes: `/` (landing page) and `/login`
- Protected routes: All other routes require authentication
- Automatic redirection to login page for unauthenticated users
- Automatic redirection to dashboard for authenticated users trying to access login page
