## API Design

### RESTful Endpoints

1. **Enterprise Management**

   - `/api/enterprises`
   - `/api/enterprises/{id}/devices`
   - `/api/enterprises/{id}/policies`
   - `/api/enterprises/{id}/users`

2. **Tower Management**

   - `/api/towers`
   - `/api/towers/{id}/carriers`
   - `/api/towers/{id}/coverage`
   - `/api/towers/{id}/devices`

3. **Device Management**

   - `/api/devices`
   - `/api/devices/{id}/policies`
   - `/api/devices/{id}/usage`
   - `/api/devices/{id}/status`

4. **Carrier Management**
   - `/api/carriers`
   - `/api/carriers/{id}/towers`
   - `/api/carriers/{id}/coverage`
   - `/api/carriers/{id}/performance`

### WebSocket Events
